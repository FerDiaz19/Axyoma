# Logout Fix Summary

## Problem
The logout buttons in the dashboard components were redirecting to `/login` instead of the correct path `/` (localhost). This was causing users to be directed to a non-existent `/login` route instead of the main application login page.

## Solution
Fixed the logout redirect in both dashboard components:

### Files Modified:
1. **PlantaAdminDashboard.tsx** - Line 49
2. **EmpresaAdminDashboard.tsx** - Line 68

### Changes Made:
- Changed `window.location.href = '/login'` to `window.location.href = '/'`
- This ensures users are redirected to the correct root path where the login component is rendered

### Verification:
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully without errors
- ✅ All logout redirects now point to `/` (localhost)
- ✅ Other components (SuperAdminDashboard, Header) were already correctly implemented
- ✅ Application routing is consistent - root path (`/`) renders the Dashboard component which handles both login and dashboard views

## Files Status:
- `SuperAdminDashboard.tsx`: ✅ Already correct (uses onLogout prop)
- `PlantaAdminDashboard.tsx`: ✅ Fixed
- `EmpresaAdminDashboard.tsx`: ✅ Fixed  
- `Header.tsx`: ✅ Already correct (uses window.location.reload())

## Result:
All dashboard logout buttons now correctly redirect users to localhost (/) instead of localhost/login, ensuring proper navigation back to the login interface.
